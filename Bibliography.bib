	abstract="We address a particular class of bilevel linear programming problems in which all the variables are discrete. The main computational complexities are analyzed and two enhanced exact algorithms are proposed. The rationale behind these two algorithms is described and a modified version is presented for both. A common test bed is used to assess their computational efficiency along with a comparison with an existing benchmark algorithm.",

	abstract="This paper first presents a formulation for a class of hierarchial problems that show a two-stage decision making process; this formulation is termed multilevel programming and could be defined, in general, as a mathematical programming problem (master) containing other multilevel programs in the constraints (subproblems). A two-level problem is analyzed in detail, and we develop a solution procedure that replaces the subproblem by its Kuhn-Tucker conditions and then further transforms it into a mixed integer quadratic programming problem by exploiting the disjunctive nature of the complementary slackness conditions.",
